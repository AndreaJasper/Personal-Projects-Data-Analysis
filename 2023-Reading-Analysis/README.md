## Overview
The 2023 Reading Analysis project aims to delve into my reading habits and preferences over the course of the year. By analyzing the books my read, genres explored, reading frequency, and other relevant factors, this project seeks to uncover insights into my literary interests and patterns.

### Data Source
I kept track of my reading habits throughout the year for use in this project.

## Languages and Programs Used
- Python
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- Tableau
- Excel

### Questions Asked
- What is the distribution of book types (e.g., fiction, non-fiction)?
- What is the average rating given to books?
- Is there a correlation between book length and rating?
- Average time to complete a book?
- Are there certain periods o the year when more books are read?
- Are there differences in ratings based on author gender?
- What is the average time taken to finish books of different genres?

### Techniques
- **Column Type Conversion:** Converted columns from one data type to another, such as converting necessary columns to strings, and converting object columns to datetime.
- **Data Cleaning:** Replaced columns names with spaces to underscorces to enable use of dot notation.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new columns to calculate the duration to finish books from start and end dates, extracting the month from dates.
- **Agregation and Grouping:** Grouped data based on certain criteria (e.g., gnre, author gender, month) and aggregating information within each group (e.g., counting numbers of books read, calculating average ratings and durations.)
- **Visualization Preparation:** Prepared data for visualization by computingsummary statistics and aggregating data to a suitable ranularity for visualization purposes.
